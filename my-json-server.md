# How to

* Create a repository on GitHub (<your-username>/<your-repo>)
* Create a db.json file
* Visit https://my-json-server.typicode.com/<your-username>/<your-repo> to access your server
No registration. Nothing to install.

in this case: `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jberends/jotdown-react`

# Example

You can check the following server as an example:
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo

# Alpha
For the moment, the project is in alpha which means many things may change or break:

* URLs may change
* Service may be down
* Authentication may be added later
* etc...
Use it at your own risk. If you need a reliable solution, please install JSON Server.

# Limits
To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:

* Changes aren't persisted
* Requests are cached (1 minute)
* db.json has limits
* All servers are public
* Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)

# Roadmap
I hope to be able to support private repositories later and plan to improve this service regularly. To be notified of updates, you can follow me on Twitter @typicode.

Advices and feedbacks are welcome :)
